# casualmap
Casual map making. Because the world need more tile maps. And dungeon crawlers.

## Rationale
The rationale behind this project is pretty much non-existing. There are most probably many alternatives out there that can do just what casualmap does and more. 
Anyway, screw that, the following main points sums up what this tile map project is about.

**The casualmap project should** (at some point)
* support the generation of tile maps (1)
* offer a sweet and easy api to query a tile map (2)
* include mechanisms for map serialization/deserialization (3)

## Why should I use it?
Well, if you want to build a dungeon crawler and need a map generator you have come to the right place. You will not get fancy graphics or anything, just a nice data structure containing areas and their location on a map, guaranteed to be connected with each other via passages. Both areas and passages carry identities that can be referenced by your code to decorate them with graphics, game logic and other fun stuff.
