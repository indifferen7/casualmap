# casualmap
Casual map making. Because the world need more tile maps.

## Rationale
The rationale behind this project is pretty much non-existing. There are most probably many alternatives out there that can do just what casualmap does and more. 
Anyway, screw that, the following main points sums up what this tile map project is about.

**The casualmap project should**
* offer a sweet and easy api to work with tile maps
* include a way to generate such maps
* support for serializing and deserializing maps
