# casualmap
Casual map making. Because the world need more tile maps. And dungeon crawlers.

## Rationale
The rationale behind this project is pretty much non-existing. There are most probably many alternatives out there that can do just what casualmap does and more. 
Anyway, screw that, the following main points sums up what this tile map project is about.

**The casualmap project should** (at some point)
* support the generation of tile maps (1)
* offer a sweet and easy api to query a tile map (2)
* include mechanisms for map serialization/deserialization (3)

## How do I use it?
Please check the wiki!
