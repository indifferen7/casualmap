# casualmap
Casual map making. Because the world need more tile maps. And dungeon crawlers.

## Rationale
The rationale behind this project is pretty much non-existing. There are most probably many alternatives out there that can do just what casualmap does and more. 
Anyway, screw that, the following main points sums up what this tile map project is about.

**The casualmap project should** (at some point)
* support the generation of tile maps (1)
* offer a sweet and easy api to query a tile map (2)
* include mechanisms for map serialization/deserialization (3)

The code is still work in progress. Point (1) and (2) above is somewhat implemented but quite a lot of work remain. Please check the issues to see what's in the p√≠pe.

## Okay, can you be a bit more specific?
The following image is a screen shot from the primitive JavaFX sample module (as of 2015-08-01) that exists only to demonstrate how the map generation works. This will have to do for now.
