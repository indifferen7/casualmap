# casualmap
Casual map making. Because the world need more tile maps.

## Rationale
The rationale behind this project is pretty much non-existing. There are most probably many alternatives out there that can do just what casualmap does and more. 
Anyway, screw that, the following main points sums up what this tile map project is about.

**The casualmap project should (at some point) **
* offer a sweet and easy api to work with tile maps (1)
* include a way to generate such maps (2)
* support serialization and deserialization of maps (3)

The code is still work in progress. Point (1) and (2) above is somewhat implemented but quite a lot of work remain. Please check the issues to see what's in the p√≠pe.
